`dfx` is the tool you will use to interact with the IC locally and on mainnet. Go to your terminal. Install it first;
```
npm run dfx_install
```
Next you will want to start a replica, which is a local instance of the IC that you can deploy your canisters to:
```
dfx start --background
```
If you want to stop the replica, go to terminal and type:
```
dfx stop
```
You can now deploy your cannister locally;
```
npm install
dfx deploy
```
